# Detecting objects in animal and dairy sciences using machine learning models.


In the field of animal sciences, computer vision based cow detection has mostly relied on models, like YOLOv3 and YOLOv5. These models have been proven effective in scenarios as discussed by [1]. [2]. Alongside these, there are models like Mask R CNN mentioned by [3] which offers a complementary approach. However it is important to note that these are a part of the wide range of object detection methods available.

My research delves into exploring the potential of models such as DETR, YoloNAS and YOLOv8. While these advanced models haven't gained much popularity in the animal science domain yet they have shown promising performance in various domains as highlighted by [4] in their comparison between different versions of YOLO. These models hold great promise for applications in animal sciences that remain largely unexplored.

Our study specifically focuses on optimizing training processes and identifying the data batches that can maintain accuracy, a move that could reshape the norms of dataset requirements.
