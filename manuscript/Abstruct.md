## Abstract

In our study, we aimed to detect and count cows on farms using computer vision (CV). This is important for farmers, especially when clearing away cow manure through "alley flushing". Timing this process right helps reduce the risk of cows getting Mastitis, a condition that can come from manure splashes. For this work, we used the Amazon Ring camera to capture images. When we tested our system on pictures from the Virginia Tech Dairy Complex, we found some errors. These mistakes were mainly because of the camera's quality and because we started with a model made for common objects.

Our research doesn't just stop at detecting cows. We also looked at different machine learning models like YOLO v8, YOLO NAS, Mask R-CNN, and DETR. This comparison helps us understand which models work best for this job. More importantly, We're investigating the optimal dataset size required for reliable outcomes and exploring how the size selection of a particular model might vary based on this dataset size.By the end, our work will give farmers a tool to count cows and decide when to do "alley flushing", all while showing how model and data size play a role in the results.
