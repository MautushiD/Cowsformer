    "## Description about this notebook\n",
    "This notebook is designed to visually compare the performance of our three different YOLO NAS models (Small, Medium, Large) in terms of two key metrics: Mean Average Precision at 50% (MAP50) and Mean Average Precision from 50% to 95% (MAP50:95). We employed a supervision function for this evaluation. The assessment was carried out on a test dataset, which was not previously exposed to the models. This test dataset is unique as it comprises a new blend of Jersey and Holstein cow images, captured from two distinct camera perspectives: top and side views. This setup ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the models' ability to accurately detect and recognize objects in varied and realistic scenarios."
